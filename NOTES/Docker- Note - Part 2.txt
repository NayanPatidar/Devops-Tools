Getting Started with Docker

Running our first container
- $ sudo docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash
The -i cmd ensures that the standard input (stdin) remians open if not attached
allowing it to interact with the container's shell.
The -t allocates a pseudo-TTY to the container, wich allows you to enter 
commands interactively. 

- hostname
To know the name of container enter -- "hostname"

- hostname -I 
To know the IP address of the container

- sudo docker run --name myogcontainer -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash
To give a specific name to the container run --name cmd

- $ sudo docker run --name daemon_dave -d ubuntu /bin/sh -c "while true;
do echo hello world; sleep 1; done"
We used the docker run cmd with the -d flag to tell Docker to deatch the containr 
to the background. Weâ€™ve also specified a while loop as our container command.
Our loop will echo hello world over and over again until the container is stopped 
or the process stops.
