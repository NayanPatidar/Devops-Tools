-> hypervisor virtualization - One or More indepedent machines run on physical hardware via 
                               intermediation layer.
-> container virtualization - It runs on top of operating system's kernel. It allows multiple
                               isolated user instaces to be run on a single host.

Introducing Docker
Docker is an open-source engine that automates the deployment of applications into containers.
Docker adds an application deployment engine on top of a virtualized container execution 
environment. It is designed to provide a lightweight and fast environment in which to run the 
your code as well as an efficiemt workflow to get that code from your laptop to your test 
environment and then into the production. Docker is incredibly simple. Indeed, you can get started with Docker
on a minimal host running nothing but a compatible Linux kernel and a Docker
binary.

An easy and lightweight way to model reality: Docker is really fast. You can Dockerize your applications 
in minutes. Docker relies on copy and write model so the changes you made only get changed.
Docker containers take less than a second to launch. Because you don't have the overhead hypervisor 
also means that you can pack more of them into oyur hosts.
