Working with Docker images and repositries

What is Docker image?
Docker image is made up of filesystems layered over each other. At the base is
a boot filesystems, bootfs, which resembles the typical Linux/Unix boot 
filesystems.

1) The host system is th underlying physical or virtual machien where Docker
is running. It contains system files, libraries, and resources shared
by all containers.

2) The "Base Image" is the initial read-only file containing the 
core operating system. It acts as the foundation for the container's 
filesystem.

3) Every Image layer above the base image represent a additional read-only
layers added during the containers image build process. These layers contain
application-specific files, configurations and other dependancies.

4) The application files are part of this writable layer and can be modifies
by the running application
